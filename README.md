This R script utilizes the UpSetR library to generate an UpSet plot, a visualization technique used to show the intersections of sets. The input dataset contains various metrics, such as Bottleneck, Closeness, Betweenness, and EcCentricity, along with their intersections. The upset() function is employed to create the plot, with customization options such as ordering by frequency, adjusting the ratio of matrix and bar chart areas, scaling text, and modifying the point and line sizes. This plot helps in analyzing overlapping relationships between different network centrality measures.
